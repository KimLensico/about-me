            <strong>Hello <u><span id="userName"></span></u>! Welcome to my test site!</strong> I'm Kimberly; this site is for code 201. Here are some facts about me that I think would be fun to know! For this course I am supposed to put in some facts about me that I would like you to know! (They're pretty easy to remember. :P) <br / > <br />  
            I was born and raised in Washington state so I have been in the Pacific Northwest my whole entire life. I am a first generation American citizen in both sides of my family. my family originally came from the Philippines so that classifies me as a filipina. I currently just have my high school diploma; after high school I worked at a bank for four years before becoming a full time student at Codefellows. My current goals consist of wanting to move to Seattle and pursue a career in coding there. I have a <del>baby</del> <em><strong>dog</strong></em> named Rosey who I will be taking with me too.
